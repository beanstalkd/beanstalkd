This is beanstalkd, a fast, general-purpose work queue.
See http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/ for general info.

QUICK START

    $ make
    $ ./beanstalkd

also,

    $ make 'CFLAGS=-Wall -Werror'
    $ make 'CFLAGS=-Wall -Werror -g -DDEBUG'
    $ make check
    $ make install PREFIX=/usr/local

You might need to type "gmake"; our build requires GNU make.
Requires Linux (2.6 series or later), Mac OS X, or FreeBSD.
See doc/protocol.txt for details of the network protocol.

TESTS

There are two kinds of tests here: unit tests and shell tests.

== Unit Tests ==

Test functions are in *-test.c.

== Shell Tests ==

Shell tests go in the sh-tests directory and are to be written in pairs:

    my_test.commands
    my_test.expected

Each .commands file will be nc'd to beanstalkd, and the response diff'd
with the appropriate .expected file.  If the response is not identical to the
.expected file, the test fails.  At the moment, the test harness bails upon the
first failure, but it could easily be extended to finish the tests and print
full results.

IMPORTANT: Since beanstalkd expects \r\n line endings, you must be sure to
include those in your files.  You can tell vim to do this with
  :set ff=dos
