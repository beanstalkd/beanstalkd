beanstalkd(1) -- simple, fast work queue
========================================

## SYNOPSIS

`beanstalkd` [<options>]

## DESCRIPTION

`Beanstalkd` is a simple work-queue service. Its interface is
generic, though it was originally designed for reducing the latency of
page views in high-volume web applications by running time-consuming
tasks asynchronously.

When started, `beanstalkd` opens a socket (or uses a file descriptor
provided by the init(1) system, see [ENVIRONMENT][]) and listens for
incoming connections. For each connection, it reads a sequence of
commands to create, reserve, delete, and otherwise manipulate "jobs",
units of work to be done. See file `doc/protocol.txt` in the
`beanstalkd` distribution for a thorough description of the meaning
and format of the `beanstalkd` protocol.

## OPTIONS

* `-b` <path>:
  Use a binlog to keep jobs on persistent storage in directory <path>.
  Upon startup, `beanstalkd` will recover any binlog that is present
  in <path>, then, during normal operation, append new jobs and
  changes in state to the binlog.

* `-f` <ms>:
  Call fsync(2) at most once every <ms> milliseconds. Larger values
  for <ms> reduce disk activity and improve speed at the cost of
  safety. A power failure could result in the loss of up to <ms>
  milliseconds of history.

  A <ms> value of 0 will cause `beanstalkd` to call fsync every time
  it writes to the binlog.

  (This option has no effect without `-b`.)

* `-F`:
  Never call fsync(2). Equivalent to `-f` with an infinite <ms> value.

  This is the default behavior.

  (This option has no effect without `-b`.)

* `-h`:
  Show a brief help message and exit.

* `-l` <addr>:
  Listen on address <addr> (default is 0.0.0.0).

  When <addr> starts with "unix:", the unprefixed value of it will be
  used as the local filesystem path to create a UNIX socket instead of
  a TCP socket. In this case the value of `-p` will be ignored.

  (Option `-l` has no effect if sd-daemon(5) socket activation is
  being used. See also [ENVIRONMENT][].)

* `-p` <port>:
  Listen on TCP port <port> (default is 11300).

  (Option `-p` has no effect if sd-daemon(5) socket activation is
  being used. See also [ENVIRONMENT][].)

* `-s` <bytes>:
  The size in bytes of each binlog file.

  (This option has no effect without `-b`.)

* `-u` <user>:
  Become the user <user> and its primary group.

* `-V`:
  Increase verbosity. May be used more than once to produce more
  verbose output. The output format is subject to change.

* `-v`:
  Print the version string and exit.

* `-z` <bytes>:
  The maximum size in bytes of a job.

* `-c`:
  This flag has no effect. It is kept for historical compatibility only.

* `-n`:
  This flag has no effect. It is kept for historical compatibility only.

## ENVIRONMENT

* `LISTEN_PID`, `LISTEN_FDS`:
  These variables can be set by init(1). See sd_listen_fds(3) for
  details.
