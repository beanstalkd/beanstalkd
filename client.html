<p>There is now a
<a href=http://wiki.github.com/kr/beanstalkd/client-libraries>wiki page for
beanstalk clients</a> with a more up-to-date list of supported languages.</p>

<p>Or, make your own client API. It's easy! The <a
href=http://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/tree/v1.3/doc/protocol.txt?raw=true>1.3
protocol doc</a> gives a complete description of the beanstalk protocol.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> as of version 1.0 the protocol will remain compatible until
beanstalkd 2.0. Any client written to work with a 1.x beanstalkd will also
work, unchanged, with any later beanstalkd before 2.0.</p>

<p>You can find the bleeding-edge latest <a
href="http://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/tree/master/doc/protocol.txt">protocol.txt
in git</a>.
