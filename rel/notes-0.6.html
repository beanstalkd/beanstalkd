<h1>Beanstalkd 0.6 Release Notes</h1>

<p><a href=..>Back to beanstalkd home page</a>.</p>

<pre>
I'm happy to announce beanstalkd 0.6.

This release has several protocol changes and other updates. This server won't
work with a client designed for any earlier beanstalkd.


WHAT'S NEW
----------

 * Server returns the newly-inserted job id.
 * The time-to-run (aka timeout) is now given for every job.
 * Build fixes on Mac OS X.
 * Minor speed improvements.
 * The server is more strict about trailing garbage on command lines.
 * Better error reporting -- the server won't just close the connection.

KNOWN BUGS
----------

 * The min heap data structure is not dynamically-sized. This means a
   fixed hard limit on the number of ready jobs (by default set to
   around 16 million).
