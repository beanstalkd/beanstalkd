<h1>Beanstalkd 0.8 Release Notes</h1>

<p><a href=..>Back to beanstalkd home page</a>.</p>

<pre>
I'm proud to announce beanstalkd 0.8.

This release has several significant protocol changes. This server won't work
with a client designed for any earlier beanstalkd.


WHAT'S NEW
----------

 * Build fix on OpenSolaris prior to snv_72.
 * Dynamically sized priority queues.
 * The minimum ttr is now one second.
 * Major new feature: Tubes.
 * Job priority is no longer part of the reservation response line. It has been
   moved to the job stats.
 * Job stats has been moved into its own command: stats-job.
